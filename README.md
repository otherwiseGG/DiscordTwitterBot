You will need:

Please do each line at one time, this shouldn’t take more than a minute.

## Configuration (config.json)

The file says: `“discordBotToken”:””, “twitterConsumerKey”:””,` (continuous)

So when talking about for example the `discordBotToken`, please change it so it looks like: `“discordBotToken”:””,` `“twitterConsumerKey”:””,`

 - To find the discordBotToken, go to [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) , create an application by pressing “New Application” or go for a pre-existing application, then in the section “Bot”, create one. Beneath the username it should say “Token”. Hit “Copy” and enter it in

## Twitter Developer

You will need to have access to Twitter Developer, and create an application in [https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard) for 4 of the values.

 - To find the `twitterConsumerKey`, in the Twitter Developer Portal, in the new project created, select “Keys and tokens” and go to “Consumer Keys”. Besides “API Keys & Secrets” please view it. Regenerate if needed. The API Key is the value
 - To find the `twitterConsumerSecret`, stay on the tab stated in `twitterConsumerKey` and copy the “API key secret”.
 - To find the `twitterAccessTokenKey`, go back to the “Keys and tokens” page and scroll down to “Authentication Tokens”, please regenerate the “Access Token & Secret” and copy the “Access token” into this.
 - To find the `twitterAccessTokenSecret`, stay on the tab stated in `twitterAccessTokenKey` and copy the “Access token secret” into config.json.

## Twitter Configuration

 - The following is an array, so you can follow multiple people, so the value may look like `[“twitter-a”]` or `[“twitter-a”,”twitter-b”]` or even `[“<twittera”,”twitter-b”,”twitter-c”]`. These values however must be the user’s ID, which you can find at [https://tweeterid.com/](https://tweeterid.com/) – so for example, @ESLotherwise is 4293668297

## Discord Configuration

 - The `channelsToPost` is also an array like following. To find these values, make sure you have developer mode on discord, then simply right click a channel and press “Copy ID” and paste it in. Please make sure it is in an array format.
 - The title is the title of what you want to come up, so for example “New Tweet”
 - The colour is the colour that the line is, so for example #1A91DA is the Twitter Blue
